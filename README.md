# Hi :)

I'm a IA Engineer with a passion for turning data into intelligent solutions and an insatiable curiosity for the world of Generative AI and NLP.

I'm currently on a journey to deepen my knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI frameworks, and how to operate them efficiently and at scale (LLMOps). This space is a reflection of my continuous learning and the projects where I get my hands dirty.

### My current focus

* **Diving deep into NLP:** Exploring advanced techniques, architectures like Transformers, and their practical applications.
* **The Generative AI ecosystem:** Studying and experimenting with frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and APIs from OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock, Hugging Face, etc.
* **MLOps & LLMOps:** Always searching for best practices to automate, monitor, and deploy machine learning models in production.
